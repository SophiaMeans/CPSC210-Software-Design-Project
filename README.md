# My Personal Project

## Caretaker Application

Updated plan: I will create a patient centered application that will function as an interface for a patient or family member
to organize their care. It will include functionality for the patient like editing and viewing the medications or conditions that they
have, creating caretaker profiles and adding them to their list of caretakers, and scheduling caretaker shifts. 

This project is of interest to me because I am hoping to volunteer at the Point Grey
Hospital this term working with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients. Additionally, I care 
for my grandfather when I am home along with a team of caretakers.
